        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of Harmony Hub is to create a website for people to discover new music and genres that they have not before. This includes explaining different genres as well as introducing new and upcoming artists that are not well known. This is possible by using the search bar to find new songs by artist or genre, or by exploring the random music choices that appear.</p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>My audience consists of music enthusiasts and casual listeners. This website is a resource for people looking to discover new music or explore different genres.</p>
        <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
        <p>For my website, I will be including multiple functions in Javascript to handle the form submission on the main page along with the random generation of songs in the child page for users to view. After the form is submitted, it will display the contents of the submission underneath it dynamically without restarting the page through prevent default.</p> 

        <p>Furthermore, I will be using the DOM to select different songs to display based on search input. Through the search input, users will be able to find songs based on artist or genre. These songs and their information (song name, artist name, and genre(s)) will be stored into an object that will be accessed through conditional branching and the ES module, filter, to display songs based on what the user put into the search input. Lastly, event listeners will be implemented to the search bar and the form submisison so that it can trigger the functions needed to make those two features work. </p>
